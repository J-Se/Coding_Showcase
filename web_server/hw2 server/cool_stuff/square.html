<p>I used to be a renegade<br>
I used to fool around<br>
But I couldn't take the punishment<br>
And had to settle down<br>
Now I'm playing it real straight<br>
And yes, I cut my hair<br>
You might think I'm crazy<br>
But I don't even care<br>
'Cause I can tell what's going on<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
I like my bands in business suits<br>
I watch them on TV<br>
I'm working out most every day<br>
And watchin' what I eat<br>
They tell me that it's good for me<br>
But I don't even care<br>
I know that it's crazy<br>
I know that it's nowhere<br>
But there is no denying that<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
So hip to be square<br>
It's not too hard to figure out<br>
You see it every day<br>
And those that were the farthest out<br>
Have gone the other way<br>
You see them on the freeway<br>
It don't look like a lot of fun<br>
But don't you try to fight it<br>
An idea whose time has come<br>
Don't tell me that I'm crazy<br>
Don't tell me I'm nowhere<br>
Take it from me<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
It's hip to be square<br>
So hip to be square<br>
Tell 'em, boys<br>
So hip to be square<br>
(Hip, hip)</p>
