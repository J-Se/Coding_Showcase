# Web Server

This is some code to run a simple web server on your local machine. To start the server, run the command ```python webServer.py```. Then, you can access the local files by going to a web browser and typing ```localhost:50000/[file name]```. For example, ```localhost:50000/HelloWorld.html```. Some sample files are included in this directory for convenience.
