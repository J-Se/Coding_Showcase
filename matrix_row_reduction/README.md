# Matrix Row-Reducer

This program row-reduces a matrix. I made it for my personal use, so it does not have many frills. To run the program, issue the following commands.

```
g++ matReduce.cpp -o mr
./mr
```

The program will then prompt you for the rest of the inputs. The output displays the original matrix followed by the row-reduced matrix.
